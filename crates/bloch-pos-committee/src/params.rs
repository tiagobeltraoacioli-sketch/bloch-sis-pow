/// carryover plus allocations only, and `CommittedState::genesis` seeds the
/// registry bonds with no eUTXO counterpart and no `issued_sat` contribution.
/// All 64 withdrawal credentials are one address — the founder's carried
/// H160, zero-padded to 32 bytes (pinned by test against the published
/// manifest). Whether that principal is (1) recognised as retroactive
/// emission (`issued_sat += 160e12` once, at the first boundary past the
/// gate, shrinking future emission by 0.0037%), (2) re-backed by burning an
/// equal amount of the founder's liquid coins, or (3) written off so a
