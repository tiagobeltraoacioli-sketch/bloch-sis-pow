//! Transport selection, and the devnet TCP mesh.
//!
//! Two transports live behind [`Net`]:
//!
//! - [`p2p`](crate::p2p) — **the production layer**: libp2p, gossipsub with
//!   the 2026-08-07 mesh fixes, a Genesis-4-only protocol prefix, directed
//!   paginated sync, and `gossip.rs` wired as admission control.
//! - the devnet full mesh below — kept, unchanged, because a 64-validator
//!   devnet across five hosts finalized on it and that result must stay
//!   reproducible. Selected with `--transport devnet`, which is still the
//!   default; `--transport libp2p` opts into the production stack.
//!
//! The engine talks to both through the same two calls — [`Net::broadcast`]
//! with a typed frame, and [`Net::report`] with a verdict — so nothing in the
//! consensus loop knows which transport it is running on.
//!
//! ## The devnet mesh, and what it is not
//!
//! **This is not the production network layer.** What a devnet needs from the
//! network is only: every node eventually sees every block and attestation,
//! and a restarted node can ask a peer for the blocks it missed. A full mesh
//! over localhost delivers exactly that with no relay logic (everyone sends to
//! everyone, so nothing needs re-gossiping) and no peer scoring. It has no
//! authentication, no admission control, and it does not carry an [`Origin`],
//! so `gossip.rs`'s verdicts have nowhere to go on this path — the engine
//! still runs the pool, but a `Reject` costs the sender nothing here.
//!
//! Wire: `u32 LE frame length ‖ type byte ‖ payload`.
//! Types: 0x01 block envelope, 0x02 attestation, 0x03 get-blocks{after_slot},
//! 0x04 transaction ([`FRAME_TX`], payload = one transaction's canonical
//! bytes). All four are live: 0x04 is written by [`send_transaction`], decoded
//! by `decode_event`, and republished on the production transport by `p2p`.
//!
//! Topology per peer pair: each side dials the other (two TCP connections per
//! pair). A node broadcasts in **both** directions — [`DevnetMesh::broadcast`]
//! sends to every peer it dialed and to every connection that dialed it —
//! because the "each side dials the other" assumption does not hold on
//! Genesis-4 mainnet, where broadcasting outbound-only silently stranded every
//! peer this node had not dialed (the `inbound` field carries that story).
//! Sync requests still go out on outbound connections only, and are answered
//! by the peer's inbound handler on the same socket.
